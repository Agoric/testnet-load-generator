/* global LOCKDOWN_OPTIONS process */
// 'lockdown' appears on the global as a side-effect of importing 'ses'
import 'ses';

// Install our HandledPromise global.
// import '@agoric/eventual-send/shim.js';

// For testing under Ava, and also sometimes for testing and debugging in
// general, when safety is not needed, you perhaps want to use
// packages/SwingSet/tools/install-ses-debug.js instead of this one.
// If you're using a prepare-test-env-ava.js, it is probably already doing that
// for you.

// The`@agoric/import-ses` package exists so the "main" of production code can
// start with the following import or its equivalent.
// ```js
// import '@agoric/install-ses';
// ```
// But production code must also be tested. Normal ocap discipline of passing
// explicit arguments into the `lockdown`
// call would require an awkward structuring of start modules, since
// the `install-ses` module calls `lockdown` during its initialization,
// before any explicit code in the start module gets to run. Even if other code
// does get to run first, the `lockdown` call in this module happens during
// module initialization, before it can legitimately receive parameters by
// explicit parameter passing.
//
// Instead, for now, `install-ses` violates normal ocap discipline by feature
// testing global state for a passed "parameter". This is something that a
// module can but normally should not do, during initialization or otherwise.
// Initialization is often awkward.
//
// The `install-ses` module tests, first,
// for a JavaScript global named `LOCKDOWN_OPTIONS`, and second, for an
// environment
// variable named `LOCKDOWN_OPTIONS`. If either is present, its value should be
// a JSON encoding of the options bag to pass to the `lockdown` call. If so,
// then `install-ses` calls `lockdown` with those options. If there is no such
// feature, `install-ses` calls `lockdown` with appropriate settings for
// production use.

    // The default `{errorTaming: 'safe'}` setting, if possible, redacts the

    // will look for the stack there and become much less useful if it is
    // missing. In production, the settings in this file need to preserve
    // security, so the 'unsafe' setting below MUST always be commented out
    // except during private development.

    // The default `{stackFiltering: 'concise'}` setting usually makes for a

    // of the normal verbose stack traces. Which is why we comment
    // out the `'verbose'` setting is commented out below. However, some
    // tools look for the full filename that it expects in order
    // to fetch the source text for diagnostics,
    //
    // Another reason for not commenting it out: The cause
    // of the bug may be anywhere, so the `'noise'` thrown out by the default
    // `'concise'` setting may also contain the signal you need. To see it,
    // uncomment out the following line. But please do not commit it in that
    // state.

    // The default `{overrideTaming: 'moderate'}` setting does not hurt the

    // the vscode debugger's object inspector. During debug and test, if you can
    // avoid legacy code that needs the `'moderate'` setting, then the `'min'`
    // setting reduces debugging noise yet further, by turning fewer inherited
    // properties into accessors.

    // The default `{consoleTaming: 'safe'}` setting usually makes for a

    // in case the SES `console` is getting in the way, we provide the
    // `'unsafe'` option for leaving the original `console` in place.
